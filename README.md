# This is a simple set of codes to help you get the pictures of your coin collection cropped up and centered

As is the case with most other non-ML CV algorithms, no one shoe fits all the sizes. I found coinSegment.py to give almost perfect results on my foreign coin collection, but about 50% accuracy on my Indian Coin Collection (which has a lot more aluminium coins). At the same time, coinSegment3.py, which had an accuracy of about 60% on my foreign coins gave near perfect results for my Indian coins.

So feel free to experiment and come out with the best output
